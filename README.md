# 256! A 2048 Clone.

## Learning Competencies

* Build a JavaScript interface independent of a backend.
* Build a complex JS model independent of the interface.
* Integrate the JS model with the HTML interface.

## Summary

Let's build a clone of the game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

We will implement the core game play. Play the game for a few minutes so you
understand the rules of the game. How do blocks spawn? When does the game
disallow a movement? How do blocks merge? How do blocks slide? Try to write a
specification of how the game mechanics work.
